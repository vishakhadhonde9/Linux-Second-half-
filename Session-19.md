# Subnetting-
- Subnetting is the process of dividing a larger network into smaller subnetworks (subnets) to improve efficiency and security.
- Smaller subnets reduce network congestion and improve performance by limiting broadcast traffic.

# CIDR-
- CIDR stands for Classless Inter-Domain Routing.
- It is a method for allocating IP addresses.
# IP Address Structure: 
### IP addresses are typically divided into two parts:
- the network portion
-  the host portion.
# Subnet Mask: 
- The subnet mask is used to determine which part of an IP address is the network portion and which part is the host portion.
- a.b.c.d/n, n represent network part or fixed bits.
- For example, in the IP address 192.168.1.0/24, /24 denotes that the first 24 bits represent the network part and the remaining 8 bits represent the host part.
- Subnet mask of 255.255.255.0 in decimal translates to 11111111.11111111.11111111.00000000 in binary, indicating that the first 24 bits are network bits and the last 8 bits are host bits.
