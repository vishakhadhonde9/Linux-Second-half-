## Archiving and Compression-
- Archiving is the process of Bundling and Compression.
- Bundling is the process of combining multiple files and directories (same or different sizes) into one file/place.
- On the other hand, compression is the process of reducing the size of a file or directory.

# tar command-
 - tar is commonly used to bundle files and directories together into a single archive file, which can then be compressed if desired.
### tar <-options> <compress_fileName>.tar <files_to_be_compressed>
#### options-
- -c -> create an archive.
- -f -> file name. (Compulsory option)
- -v -> verbose or view.
- -t -> list the content from archive.
- -x -> execute the content from archive.
- -C -> copy content from an archive to another directory.

# Compression-
- Compression is a reduction in the number of bits needed to represent data.
- Compressing data can save storage capacity, speed up file transfer, and decrease costs for storage hardware and network bandwidth.

## GZIP: 
- GZIP is good option for compressing a lot of data as it is quick.
- Its memory usage is also low.
- GZIP compression can be used by using “-z” option in tar command or by using gzipcommand.
- GZIP compressed file can be extracted using gunzip.
## BZIP2:
- BZIP2 provide better compression ratio compared to GZIP but require more "CPU time" to accomplish it.
- “-j” option in tar or bzip2 command can be used for bzip2 compression.
- Bunzip2 is command to extract bzip2 compressed file.
## XZ:
- XZ provide impressive compression ration but in cost of very high CPU and Memory usage.
- Decompression speed is better but it also consumes a lot of memory.
- XZ compression can be done by “-J” option in tar or xz command.
